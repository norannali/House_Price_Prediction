# House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict house prices based on historical data. We utilize machine learning algorithms to train a model that can predict the price of a house given its features such as square footage, number of rooms, and more.

## Project Overview

In this project, I explore various machine learning models to predict the sale price of houses. The dataset contains different features that influence the price, and the goal is to build a reliable prediction model.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- **SalePrice**: the target variable (price of the house)
- **LotArea**: size of the lot
- **OverallQual**: overall material and finish quality
- **GrLivArea**: above grade living area square feet
- Other features like number of rooms, year built, and garage size.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
